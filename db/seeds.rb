UserGym.create(rating: 3, review: "I love this place. I highly recommend this place to anyone who wants to get in shape. The trainers are really awesome and helpful, they make you feel really comfortable. The 45 min training goes super fast and you really enjoy doing it. Everyday is a new training, so it is never boring.", user_id: jake.id, gym_id: ultimate.id )
UserGym.create(rating: 2, review: "I started my membership in early 2020, but cancelled in April due to COVID. I have been waiting for a promised refund ever since. Their emails keep promising 5 days, then 30, then 5-6. I have been a fitness member of a variety of clubs for more than 30 years. This one is THE biggest disappointment!! Don't waste your money. There are other choices!", user_id: jake.id, gym_id: evolution.id )

UserGym.create(rating: 3, review: "Excellent personal training. Trainers who really care and go above and beyond to help you achieve your goals. Small and private gym that feels more personal. Highly recommended!", user_id: luie.id, gym_id: radical.id )
UserGym.create(rating: 3, review: "This gym has the best energy, staff, and feel. Everything is so clean, every trainer closely watches and corrects everyone‚Äôs form, and a DJ on Saturday. Keep doing exactly what you are doing.", user_id: luie.id, gym_id: uma.id )

UserGym.create(rating: 5, review: "Great mix of functional fitness with traditional gym equipment. Lots of space for Olympic lifting too. Unless you‚Äôre here in the early morning or the evening, there are never too many people which is nice. There are classes offered in the morning, at noon and in the evening ‚Äì good, varied range of different options.", user_id: wm.id, gym_id: andersons.id )

UserGym.create(rating: 4, review: "The workouts are fun, the fellow members are inspiring, the workouts are led by personal trainers who give hands on instant feedback and adjustments during the workouts and just the right amount of encouragement. The music is blaring and the atmosphere is awesome. You will not do the same workout twice and if you go you will see the results no question. It‚Äôs a life changing gym experience and I recommend it highly to all my fiends and family.", user_id: jackle.id, gym_id: ronin.id )
