UserGym.create(rating: 3, review: "I love this place. I highly recommend this place to anyone who wants to get in shape. The trainers are really awesome and helpful, they make you feel really comfortable. The 45 min training goes super fast and you really enjoy doing it.

There are other choices!", user_id: wm.id, gym_id: evolution.id )

UserGym.create(rating: 4, review: "The workouts are fun, the fellow members are inspiring, the workouts are led by personal trainers who give hands on instant feedback and adjustments during the workouts and just the right amount of encouragement. The music is blaring and the atmosphere is awesome. You will not do the same workout twice and if you go you will see the results no question. It‚Äôs a life changing gym experience and I recommend it highly to all my fiends and family.", user_id: wm.id, gym_id: ronin.id )
